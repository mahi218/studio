2. **`src/lib/appwrite-client.ts`** - Client-side services for React components
3. **`src/lib/appwrite-services.ts`** - Server-side Appwrite services
4. **`src/hooks/use-appwrite-auth.ts`** - React hook for authentication
5. **`.env.local`** - Environment variables template
6. **`Backend/APPWRITE_SETUP.md`** - Detailed setup instructions
7. **`Backend/setup-appwrite.js`** - Automated setup script

### Modified Files:
1. **`src/lib/actions.ts`** - Updated to use Appwrite services
2. **`package.json`** - Added setup script and new dependencies

## 🚀 What's Implemented

### Authentication System
- ✅ Employee registration with Appwrite Auth
- ✅ Employee login with session management
- ✅ Admin login with passcode verification
- ✅ Session management with both Appwrite and local cookies
- ✅ Logout functionality

### Database Operations
- ✅ User management (employees and admins)
- ✅ Report creation and management
- ✅ Report status tracking and replies
- ✅ Proper data validation and error handling

### File Storage
- ✅ Image upload for reports
- ✅ File storage in Appwrite Storage
- ✅ Image viewing and management

### AI Integration
- ✅ Department suggestion still works with Genkit
- ✅ Integration maintained with existing AI flows

## 🛠️ Next Steps to Get Running

### 1. Set Up Appwrite Project
1. Go to [cloud.appwrite.io](https://cloud.appwrite.io) and create account
2. Create new project named "IssueTrack Pro"
3. Get your project ID

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Update `.env.local` with your actual Appwrite project details:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id
# ... other variables
```

### 3. Create Database Structure
Follow the detailed instructions in `Backend/APPWRITE_SETUP.md` to:
- Create database
- Create collections (users, reports)
- Set up storage bucket
- Configure permissions

### 4. Test the Implementation
```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

### 5. Optional: Use Automated Setup
```bash
# After getting API key from Appwrite
npm run setup-appwrite
```

## 🔧 Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
1. **Frontend** → Actions (`src/lib/actions.ts`)
2. **Actions** → Appwrite Services (`src/lib/appwrite-services.ts`)
3. **Services** → Appwrite Cloud Database
4. **Response** ← Back through the chain

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login/register form
2. Server action validates input
3. Appwrite service handles auth
4. Local session created for compatibility
5. User redirected to appropriate page

### File Upload Flow
1. User selects image in report form
2. Image converted to data URI
3. Server processes and uploads to Appwrite Storage
4. File URL stored in database
5. Image displayed in reports

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ Server-side validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ Proper authentication with Appwrite Auth
- ✅ Session management with httpOnly cookies
- ✅ File upload restrictions and validation
- ✅ Role-based access control (employee/admin)
- ✅ Environment variable protection

## 📊 Database Schema

### Users Collection
- authId (Appwrite Auth ID)
- name, email, employeeCode
- role (employee/admin)
- createdAt

### Reports Collection
- employeeName, employeeCode, employeeType
- department, description
- image (URL to stored file)
- status, submittedAt, submittedBy
- reply, repliedAt

## 🎯 Features Working

### For Employees
- Register account
- Login securely
- Submit reports with images
- View own reports
- See admin replies and status updates

### For Admins
- Login with passcode
- View all reports
- Reply to reports
- Update report status
- Manage system data

### AI Integration
- Smart department suggestion
- Image metadata analysis (if configured)

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env.local` to version control
2. **API Keys**: Keep your Appwrite API key secure
3. **Permissions**: Review Appwrite collection permissions carefully
4. **CORS**: Add your domain to Appwrite platforms
5. **Production**: Change default passwords before deployment

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Efficient data fetching with proper caching
- Image optimization through Appwrite Storage
- Lazy loading of components

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions are documented in `Backend/APPWRITE_SETUP.md`
